## How to Play 🎮

Uncover all safe cells without clicking on a mine 💣

- **Flag suspected mines:** Right-click a cell to place a flag (flag as many as you like).
- **Open cells:** Left-click to reveal a cell. If it’s a mine, the game ends.
- **After a loss:** Incorrect flags show a ❌, correct flags stay 🚩, and all remaining mines are revealed.
- **Numbers:** Each number shows how many mines are in the 8 **adjacent** cells.
- **Fair start:** Mines are placed **after** your first left-click and never on the first cell you open.

**Difficulty Levels:**

| Level        | Board Size           | Mines |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Beginner     | 9 × 9                | 10    |
| Intermediate | 16 × 16              | 40    |
| Expert       | 16 × 30              | 80    |
